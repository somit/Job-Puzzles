1) Array Sum Challenge
---------------------------------
In this challenge, given an array of integers, the goal is to efficiently find the subarray that has the greatest value when all of its elements are summed together. Note that because some elements of the array may be negative, the problem is not solved by simply picking the start and end elements of the array to be the subarrray, and summing the entire array. 

int max_sum(int *vector, int len)
{
    int best = 0, current = 0;
    int i = 0;
    for(i = 0; i < len; ++i)
    {
        current += *(vector + i);
        if(current < 0)
        {
            current = 0;
        }
        best = best > current ? best : current;
    }
    return best;
}

2) Big Endian Little Endian
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/archives/801
Normal storage: big endian machines, first byte of binary representation of the multibyte data-type is stored last.

What are bi-endians?
Bi-endian processors can run in both modes little and big endian.

What are the examples of little, big endian and bi-endian machines ?
Intel based processors are little endians. ARM processors were little endians. Current generation ARM processors are bi-endian.

Motorola 68K processors are big endians. PowerPC (by Motorola) and SPARK (by Sun) processors were big endian. Current version of these processors are bi-endians.

Does endianness effects file formats?
File formats which have 1 byte as a basic unit are independent of endianness e..g., ASCII files . Other file formats use some fixed endianness forrmat e.g, JPEG files are stored in big endian format.

Compile-time Tests:
--------------------
The sys/param.h header normally defines the symbols __BYTE_ORDER, __BIG_ENDIAN, __LITTLE_ENDIAN, and __PDP_ENDIAN. You can test endianness by doing something like:

   #include <sys/param.h>

   #ifdef __BYTE_ORDER
   # if __BYTE_ORDER == __LITTLE_ENDIAN
   #  define I_AM_LITTLE_ENDIAN
   # else
   #  if __BYTE_ORDER == __BIG_ENDIAN
   #   define I_AM_BIG_ENDIAN
   #  else
       Error: unknown byte order!
   #  endif
   # endif
   #endif /* __BYTE_ORDER */


RUntime Test:
---------------

int main()
{
   unsigned int i = 1;
   char *c = (char*)&i;
   if (*c)
       printf("Little endian");
   else
       printf("Big endian");
   getchar();
   return 0;
 
}


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Extern

1. Declaration can be done any number of times but definition only once.
2. “extern” keyword is used to extend the visibility of variables/functions().
3. Since functions are visible through out the program by default. The use of extern is not needed in function declaration/definition. Its use is redundant.
4. When extern is used with a variable, it’s only declared not defined.
5. As an exception, when an extern variable is declared with initialization, it is taken as definition of the variable as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Output of this:
int main( )
{
char ch[16]="the world is";
ch[13]='b';
printf("%s",ch);
}

output: the world is
Thought:-> ch[12] is still '\0' where string will end so it only prints till then.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5)/* printf example */
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
   printf ("Characters: %c %c \n", 'a', 65);
   printf ("Decimals: %d %ld\n", 1977, 650000L);
   printf ("Preceding with blanks: %10d \n", 1977);
   printf ("Preceding with zeros: %010d \n", 1977);
   printf ("Some different radixes: %d %x %o %#x %#o \n", 100, 100, 100, 100, 100);
   printf ("floats: %4.2f %+.0e %E \n", 3.1416, 3.1416, 3.1416);
   printf ("Width trick: %*d \n", 5, 10);
   printf ("%s \n", "A string");
   return 0;
}


And here is the output:

Characters: a A
Decimals: 1977 650000
Preceding with blanks:       1977
Preceding with zeros: 0000001977
Some different radixes: 100 64 144 0x64 0144
floats: 3.14 +3e+000 3.141600E+000
Width trick:    10
A string

6) Casting
int main()
{
    char arr[5][7][6];
    char (*p)[5][7][6] = &arr;
 
    /* Hint: &arr - is of type pointer to an array of
       5 two dimensional arrays of size [7][6] */
 
    printf("%d\n", (&arr + 1) - &arr);
    printf("%d\n", (char *)(&arr + 1) - (char *)&arr);
    printf("%d\n", (unsigned)(arr + 1) - (unsigned)arr);
    printf("%d\n", (unsigned)(p + 1) - (unsigned)p);
 
    return 0;
}
Output:

7)Facts:
a)In C/C++, initialization of a multidimensional arrays can have left most dimension as optional. Except the left most dimension, all other dimensions must be specified.
b)In C++(in C both fails), pre-increment (or pre-decrement) can be used as l-value, but post-increment (or post-decrement) can not be used as l-value.
++a = 20; // works
a++=20; //fails
c)In C, it is never safe to depend on the order of evaluation of side effects. For example, a function call like below may very well behave differently from one compiler to another:

void func (int, int);
 
int i = 2;
func (i++, i++);
There is no guarantee (in either the C or the C++ standard language definitions) that the increments will be evaluated in any particular order. Either increment might happen first. func might get the arguments `2, 3′, or it might get `3, 2′, or even `2, 2′.

Source: http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Non_002dbugs.html
d)In C language, sizeof( ) is an operator. Though it looks like a function, it is an unary operator.
e)In ISO C, you can define main either to take no arguments, or to take two arguments that represent the command line arguments to the program, like this:

int main (int argc, char *argv[])
Other platform-dependent formats are also allowed by the C and C++ standards; for example, Unix (though not POSIX.1) and Microsoft Visual C++ have a third argument giving the program’s environment, otherwise accessible through getenv in stdlib.h:

char * pPath;
pPath = getenv ("PATH");
if (pPath!=NULL)
printf ("The current path is: %s",pPath);

f)int arr[2]={6,0};
 
arr => first place , arr+1 = second place(4 adds up);
&arr= starting of whole array ie first plac so arr==&arr,
now &arr+1 -> &a + 8 postions forward( as arr has size=2 so 4*2)

char *str= "somit";strlen =5 ,sizeof(str)= 4(pointer size)
char str[]="somit; srtlen=5 , sizeof(str)=6 ( 5 places + 1 '\0')

Pointers for functions: -> int (*foo)(int);  here foo is function

void (*p_function)(int) = NULL;
p_function = &function;
p_function(blaaaaaaaa);
